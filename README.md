# MVC Lecture Slides

## Overview

This repository contains my lecture on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, presented as a Google Slides slideshow.

## Why I Made This Lecture

I created these slides to deepen my understanding of MVC architecture. By preparing and teaching the material, I was able to explore the pattern’s core principles, its use in web development, and how MVC separates concerns for cleaner, more maintainable code.

## How It Helped My Understanding

- **Researching and organizing** content clarified concepts like separation of concerns, routing, and controller logic.
- **Explaining to others** forced me to break down complex ideas into simpler terms.
- It improved my ability to recognize and implement MVC in real projects.

## How It Can Help Others

This slideshow is designed for beginners or anyone seeking a clear introduction to MVC. It covers:
- What MVC is and why it’s used
- Examples of MVC in popular frameworks
- Step-by-step breakdowns of each component
- Practical benefits and potential pitfalls
